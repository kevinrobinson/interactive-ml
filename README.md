make it up as you go

### ideas
- flow in images
- project into mobilenet / umap (stabilize umap)
- prune images based on mobilenet embedding similarity
- predict with mobilenet
- project mobilenet predictions into use / umap (stabilize umap)
- allow one-by-one training, additive only
- see predictions live in windows
- see library of training examples, edit

### other ideas
