make it up as you go

### already
- flow in images
- predict with mobilenet
- project mobilenet predictions into use / umap (stabilize umap)
- move text > use > umap offline

### next
- allow one-by-one training, additive only
  https://www.tensorflow.org/js/guide/train_models
- see predictions live in windows
- project into mobilenet / umap (stabilize umap)
- prune images based on mobilenet embedding similarity
- dragging instead of clicking
- see library of training examples, edit

### other ideas
- do segmentation also, in conjunction with USE
